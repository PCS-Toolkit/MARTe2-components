/**
 * @brief A DataSourceI interface which allows to store signals in a file.
 *
 * @details Data written into this data source is temporarily stored in a circular buffer and
 * asynchronously flushed to a file either as text (csv) or binary. This circular buffer can either be
 * continuously stored or stored only when a given event occurs (see StoreOnTrigger below).
 *
 * All the signals are stored in a single file.
 * If the format is csv the first line will be a comment with each signal name, type and number of elements. A new line will be added every time all the signal samples are written.
 *
 * TODO confirm: If the format is binary an header with the following information is created: the first 4 bytes
 * contain the number of signals. Then, for each signal, the signal type will be encoded in one byte, followed
 *  by 32 bytes to encode the signal name, followed by 4 bytes which store the number of elements of a given signal.
 *  Following the header the signal samples are consecutively stored in binary format.
 *
 * TODO confirm: for both formats, arrays can be stored but all the signals shall have the same number of elements.
 *
 * This DataSourceI has the functions FlushFile and OpenFile registered as an RPC.
 *
 * The configuration syntax is (names are only given as an example):
 * +FileWriter_0 = {
 *     Class = FileWriter
 *     NumberOfBuffers = 10 //Compulsory. Number of buffers in the circular buffer defined above. Each buffer is capable of holding a copy of all the DataSourceI signals.
 *     CPUMask = 15 //Compulsory. Affinity assigned to the threads responsible for asynchronously flush data into the file.
 *     StackSize = 10000000 //Compulsory. Stack size of the thread above.
 *     Filename = "test.bin" //Optional. If not set the filename shall be set using the OpenFile RPC.
 *     Overwrite = "yes" //Compulsory. If "yes" the file will be overwritten, otherwise new data will be added to the end of the existent file.
 *     FileFormat = "binary" //Compulsory. Possible values are: binary and csv.
 *     CSVSeparator = "," //Compulsory if Format=csv. Sets the file separator type.
 *     StoreOnTrigger = 1 //Compulsory. If 0 all the data in the circular buffer is continuously stored. If 1 data is stored when the Trigger signal is 1 (see below).
 *     NumberOfPreTriggers = 2 //Compulsory iff StoreOnTrigger = 1.  Number of cycles to store before the trigger.
 *     NumberOfPostTriggers = 1 //Compulsory iff StoreOnTrigger = 1.  Number of cycles to store after the trigger.
 *
 *     Signals = {
 *         Trigger = { //Compulsory when StoreOnTrigger = 1. Must be set in index 0 of the Signals node. When the value of this signal is 1 data will be stored.
