/**
 * @brief Circular buffer acquisition from NI-9157 FIFO.
 * @details This data source can hold only one signal (over the special InternalTimeStamp and ErrorCheck signals). Depending on the signal type, a NI9157DeviceOperator
 * object is created to manage the typed read operation from the NI-9157 FIFO. The name of the variable that identifies the FIFO must be defined by the user in the configuration
 * file.
 * @details An internal thread is started in the PrepareNextState method and the object starts acquiring from the FIFO and putting the received packets in a
 * circular buffer (see CircularBufferThreadInputDataSource). The Synchronise method, allow the Brokers to get the address of the last written packet in the FIFO.
 * @details If the signal vector parameter PacketMemberSizes is specified, a interleaved to flat operation (see InterleavedXFlat) is performed before putting the packet in the
 * circular buffer.
 * @details Follows a configuration example:
 * <pre>
 * +Drv1 = {
 *     Class = NI9157CircularFifoReader
 *     NumberOfBuffers = 80  //see CircularBufferThreadInputDataSource
 *     CpuMask = 2 //see CircularBufferThreadInputDataSource
 *     sleepInMutexSec = 1e-9 //see CircularBufferThreadInputDataSource
 *     NI9157DevicePath = NiDevice //the absolute path of the NI9157Device block in the configuration database
 *     CheckFrame = 1 //if the first element is the packet counter (default 0)
 *     NumberOfPacketsInFIFO = 20 //the number of packets in the host-side FIFO (default 10)
 *     FifoName = "NiFpga_TestGTD0001_TargetToHostFifoU64_FIFO" //the name of the FIFO variable
 *     NumOfFrameForSync = 2 //the number of packets to be used if the synchronisation is lost with the device (checking the packet counter). Default 2.
 *     RunNi = 1 //if the NI9157Device has to be started by this data source
 *     CounterStep = 2000 //the gap between two consecutive packet counters (default 1)
 *     CheckCounterAfterNSteps = 2000 //when the counter must be checked. It must be multiple of CounterStep (default is equal to CounterStep).
 *     FirstPacketCounter = 1 //the first packet counter that should be acquired from the device.
 *     AcquireFromCounter = 1 //The first packet counter to be acquired. The data source wait this packet before starting to put packets in the circular buffer (default equal to FirstPacketCounter).
 *     +Signals = {
 *        Signal1 = {
 *           Type = uint32
 *           NumberOfElements = 500
 *           PacketMemberSizes = {4, 4, 4, 4}"
