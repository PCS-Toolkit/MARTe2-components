 * @brief A DataSource which provides a timing source for a MARTe application.
 * @details The LinuxTimer generates a timing signal at the frequency specified by
 * a given GAM signal.
 * The Timer shall always be configured with two, and only two, signals and it shall
 * always have a frequency set in one of the signals.

 * The configuration syntax is (names are only given as an example):
 * <pre>
 * +Timer = {
 *     Class = LinuxTimer
 *     SleepNature = Busy|Default//If SleepNature is not specified then Default is set
 *     ExecutionMode = IndependentThread //Optional. If not set ExecutionMode = IndependentThread. If ExecutionMode == IndependentThread a thread is spawned to generate the time events. ExecutionMode == RealTimeThread the time is generated in the context of the real-time thread.
 *     CPUMask = 0x8 //Optional and only relevant if ExecutionMode=IndependentThread
 *     Signals = {
 *         Counter = {
 *             Type = uint32 //int32 also supported
 *         }
 *         Time = {
 *             Type = uint32 //int32 also supported
 *             Frequency = 1000
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * If the SleepNature=Busy a Sleep::Busy will be used to wait for the 1/Frequency period to elapse, otherwise
 *  a Sleep::NoMore will be used.
