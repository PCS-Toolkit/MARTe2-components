/**
 * @brief Double buffer of sigblocks
 *
 * @description This class implements a double buffer for interchange
 * sigblocks, meant for SC/SP (single consumer and single producer)
 * running on different threads or processes through shared memory.
 *
 * Features of the double buffer:
 * * It is wait-free on reading and writing sigblocks.
 * * It manages the concepts of front buffer and back buffer.
 * * If there is not a fresh sigblock for reading, i.e. the front
 * buffer has no data, it does not block and returns error, so the
 * consumer can retry later.
 * * It always writes to the back buffer and tries to swap front and
 * back buffers, but if front buffer is being accessed by the consumer, then
 * it does not block and returns TODO Â¿error?. The next time the producer writes,
 * it will overwrite the back buffer and will try to swap again. Eventually,
 * when consumer had finished reading the front buffer, the next write will
 * swap the buffers, and the front buffer will have a fresh sigblock. In the
 * worst case, if the producer stops the consumer will be able to get the
 * penultimate sigblock put into the double buffer.
