 * @brief Circular buffer time stamp acquisition using the NI-1588 PCI-Express board.
 *
 * @details This data source allows to time stamp events on each input terminal of the NI-1588 board: TerminalPFI0, TerminalPFI1, TerminalPFI2.
 * Optionally, this data source also provides the following
 * signals to check the type of event triggered on each of the three input terminals: EventPFI0, EventPFI1, EventPFI2 (0=RISING EVENT | 1=FALLING_EVENT)
 *
 * @details The optional ErrorCheck signal, coming from the implementation of CircularBufferThreadInputDataSource
 * is populated as follows:
 *    ErrorCheck |= 0x4  //timeout expired waiting for a event\n
 *    ErrorCheck |= 0x8  //more than one event has occurred at the same time
 *
 * @details The configuration syntax is (names and signal quantities are only given as an example and * means optional):
