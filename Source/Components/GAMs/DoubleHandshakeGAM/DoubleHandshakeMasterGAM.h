/**
 * @brief This GAM implements a double handshake protocol sending commands to a slave .
 *
 * @details The \a DoubleHandshakeMasterGAM provides commands to a slave. It routes the command signals in input (that
 * can arrive from other component in the application or from a supervisor) to a slave in output, implementing the double
 * handshake protocol. The type of signals managed by this GAM are:\n
 *   - CommandIn: the input command to be provided
 *   - CommandOut: the command to the slave
 *   - AckIn: the acknowledge from the slave
 *   - ClearIn: the trigger to clear the channel
 *   - InternalState: the double handshake state machine state
 *  Follows a description of the state machine that implements the double handshake for each command channel:\n
 *   - READY: the input command signal has not changed. If the command signal changes to a value different than zero, then go to SENDING.\n
 *   - SENDING: routes the command in output to the slave. Wait for the command to be acked from the slave, then go to CLEAR state.\n
 *   - CLEAR: waits the clear signals to be zero. This means that the acknowledge response has been managed by the other components and
 *   it is possible to clear the channel. Clears the channel and go to done.
 *   - DONE: waits that the command signal is reset by the slave. Then, go to READY again.
 *
 * @details When the ack from the slave is received, other GAMs (i.e the MessageGAM) could react. Once the acknowledge response has been handled,
 * the clear trigger signal is set to zero and the DoubleHandshakeMasterGAM will clear the channel.\n
 * The DoubleHandshakeSlaveGAM recognizes the signals commands, acks and clear triggers by name convention:\n
 *   - Signals beginning with "CommandIn" are the input commands signals.\n
 *   - Signals beginning with "AckIn" are the input acknowledge signals.\n
 *   - Signals beginning with "CleatTrigIn" are the input clear trigger signals.\n
 *   - Signals beginning with "CommandOut" are the output commands signals.\n
 *   - Signals beginning with "InternalState" are the output state machine state signals.\n
 *
 * Constraints:\n
 *   - [number of in commands]==[number of out command]\n
 *   - [number of in commands]==[number of acknowledges]\n
 *   - [number of in commands]==[number of clear triggers]\n
 *   - [number of in commands]==[number of internal states]\n
 *   - [in commands type] == [out commands type]\n
 *   - [in commands type] == [acknowledges type]\n
 *   - [clear triggers type] == uint32\n
 *   - [internal states type] == uint32
 *   - The internal states signals have to be defined all together
 *
 * The internal state signals provide in output the current state of the double handshake state machine for each channel:\n
 *   - 0 = READY\n
 *   - 1 = SENDING\n
 *   - 2 = CLEAR\n
 *   - 3 = DONE\n
 *   - 4 = ERROR\n
 *
 * The double handshake state machine can go in ERROR state in this cases:\n
 *   - From READY if the slave changes the ack.\n
 *   - From SENDING if the slave sends a bad ack (different than the command value).\n
 *   - From CLEAR if the slave changes or reset the ack.\n
 *   - From DONE if the slave changes the ack to something different than zero.\n
 *   - From SENDING, CLEAR or DONE if the specified timeout expires.
 *
 * @details Follows an example of configuration:
 * <pre>
 * +DoubleHandshakeMasterGAM = {
 *    Class = DoubleHandshakeGAM::DoubleHandshakeMasterGAM
 *    InputSignals = {
 *        CommandIn = {
 *            Alias = Command
 *            NumberOfElements=2
 *            Type = uint32
 *            DataSource = DDB1
 *        }
 *        AckIn = {
 *            Trigger = 1
 *            Type = uint32
 *            NumberOfElements=2
 *            DataSource = FromSlave
 *        }
 *        ClearIn0 = {
 *            Type = uint32
 *            DataSource = DDB1
 *        }
 *        ClearIn1 = {
 *            Type = uint32
 *            DataSource = DDB1
 *        }
 *    }
 *    OutputSignals = {
 *        CommandOut0 = {
 *            Type = uint32
 *            DataSource = ToSlave
 *        }
 *        CommandOut1 = {
 *            Type = uint32
 *            DataSource = ToSlave
 *        }
 *        InternalState0 = {
 *            Type = uint32
 *            DataSource = DDB1
 *        }
 *        InternalState1 = {
 *            Type = uint32
 *            DataSource = DDB1
