/**
* @brief An interface which implements the TimeProvider generic plugin interface to provide the base primitive for time and sleep source, backed by TCN.
* @details The interface has essentially two main methods, beside ancillary ones, which can be used to:
* - Provide a source for a time-based incrementing counter;
* - Provide a sleeping method.
*
* Provider supports several operating modes, which are backed by primitives found in tcn.h header.
* For each of the supported modes, two factors are changing: one is the Counter() and the other the Sleep() behaviour.
*
* - NoPollLegacyMode:   Counter() = Falls back to HighResolutionTimer::Counter() for the source;
*                       Sleep() = Spinning on the counter value to measure intervals;
* - PollLegacyMode:     Counter() = Polls its own Counter() method which is backed by the tcn_get_time;
*                       Sleep() = Spinning on the counter to measure intervals;
* - WaitUntilMode:      Counter() = Polls its own Counter() method which is backed by the tcn_get_time;
*                       Sleep() = Blocks current thread execution by relying on the backing tcn_wait_until function;
* - WaitUntilHRMode:    Counter() = Polls its own Counter() method which is backed by the tcn_get_time;
*                       Sleep() = Blocks current thread execution by relying on the backing tcn_wait_until_hr function;
*                                 Backing function accepts a Tolerance parameter and returns the wakeup time to compute difference;
* - SleepMode:          Counter() = Polls its own Counter() method which is backed by the tcn_get_time;
*                       Sleep() = Uses the backing tcn_sleep function to achieve POSIX style sleep() using the sourcing peripheral;
* - SleepHRMode:        Counter() = Polls its own Counter() method which is backed by the tcn_get_time;
*                       Sleep() = Uses the backing tcn_sleep_hr function to achieve POSIX style sleep() using the sourcing peripheral;
*                       Backing function accepts a Tolerance parameter and returns the difference between expected and effective sleep duration;
* Period and frequency methods
* They return the current provider Period and Frequency, which are bound to the p = 1/f relationship.
*
* Usage
* The TcnTimeProvider plugin is generally configured inside the timer instance, as the LinuxTimer discovers and instantiates it as long as
* the MARTe2 configuration file is parsed. The general structure is:
* +Timer = {
*        Class = LinuxTimer
*        [...] Linux Timer specific configuration options [...]
*        +TcnProvider = {
            Class = TcnTimeProvider                             //Mandatory.
            TcnDevice = "/path/to/tcndevice/configuration.xml"  //Mandatory, path to the xml configuration for the tcn provider
            TcnPoll = 0|1                                       //Optional, parameter required for backward compatibility (Behaviour is 0 = NoPollLegacyMode | 1 = PollLegacyMode)
                                                                //The TcnPoll parameter presence overrides OperationMode. If both are present, only TcnPoll is considered.
            OperationMode = "[see above supported]"             //Optional, defaults to NoPollLegacyMode.
            Tolerance = 1000                                    //Optional, value in us only valid for HR modes (see above), defaults to 1000us.
*        }
* }
* 
* Caveats
* If the TCN initialisation fails, the DataSource immediately fails. Otherwise if an unsupported mode is selected, the Sleep function verbosely fails but the DataSource
* may keep on running with the TCN library fallback implementation. Specific errors which may be produced from the TCN underlying library are propagated using either the
* ERRNO naming (EACCES, ENOSYS, ENODEV, ENODATA, ENOENT, ENOKEY, EPERM, EBUSY). As the library brings also proprietary error codes, when they cannot be led back to their
* standard binding they are printed as integer.
